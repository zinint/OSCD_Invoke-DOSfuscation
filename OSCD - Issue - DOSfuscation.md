## Problem

The majority (>50%) of Sigma rules are based on command-line events (WEL Security Event ID 4688 and Sysmon Event ID 1), but the presence of Sigma rules for cmd.exe command Obfuscation Indicators detection is quite limited.

There is only one Sigma rule that is focusing on cmd.exe commandline obfuscation detection — [rules/windows/process_creation/win_susp_cli_escape.yml](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/process_creation/win_susp_cli_escape.yml). The most of the methods, supported by [Invoke-DOSfuscation](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-DOSfuscation) are not covered at all.

## Solution

We developed a table with pre-generated CMD commands, obfuscated by the [Invoke-DOSfuscation](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-DOSfuscation) framework, you can pick up some of the tasks in that table and develop Sigma rules for them.<br>
You will need to use [regular expressions](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/wiki/Specification#types) in Sigma rules. Here is a [Sigma rule](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/process_creation/win_invoke_obfuscation_obfuscated_iex_commandline.yml) developed by Daniel Bohannon (@danielhbohannon) that utilize regular expressions in Sigma rule:

## The Approach
There are numerous building blocks that must be combined to perform the advanced payload encoding techniques. Searching for these building blocks in process arguments, common persistence locations and in file repositories is a good first step in reducing the data set when building robust detections for DOSfuscation in general. We're going to use Sigma so we will look for those building blocks in command-line events (WEL Security Event ID 4688 and Sysmon Event ID 1).

Some basic building block concepts for each of the four encoding techniques are outlined below:
* Concatenation
   * Numerous set commands + logical operators & or && + call command 
   ```cmd
   cmd /c “set com3= /ano&&set com2=stat&&set com1=net&& call set final=%com1%%com2%%com3%&&call%final%”
   ```
   * Multiple adjacent environment variables for concatenation reassembly
* FORcoding
   * Set command + for loop syntax + variable substring syntax like  ```!var:~%A,1!``` + ```if``` statement + ```callcommand``` + variable substring syntax like ```%var:~7%```, ```%var:~-12%``` or ```!var:~%A,1!```
